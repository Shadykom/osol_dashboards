# Supabase Initialization Error Fix

## Issue
The application was throwing an error: `Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'ze' before initialization` in the minified Supabase module (`supabase-DifbsjIN.js`).

## Root Cause
The error was caused by a temporal dead zone issue in `/src/lib/supabase.js`. The `customFetch` function was being referenced in the Supabase client configuration before it was defined in the code.

## Solution
Moved the function definitions (`getAuthToken` and `customFetch`) before their usage in the Supabase client initialization. This ensures that the functions are available when the client is created.

### Changes Made:
1. Moved `getAuthToken` function definition from line 65 to line 40
2. Moved `customFetch` function definition from line 71 to line 46
3. These functions are now defined before being used in the `createClient` calls

## Result
- The build now completes successfully
- The initialization error has been resolved
- The Supabase client can now properly initialize with the custom fetch configuration

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
- Always define functions before using them, especially in module initialization code
- Be aware that const/let declarations are not hoisted like function declarations
- Test builds regularly to catch initialization errors early
