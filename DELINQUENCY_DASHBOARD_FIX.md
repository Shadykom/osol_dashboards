# Delinquency Executive Dashboard Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Environment Variable Configuration
The `.env` file had the `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` split across multiple lines, which caused it to be read incorrectly. This has been fixed by putting the entire key on a single line.

### 2. Null Supabase Client Handling
The `DelinquencyExecutiveDashboard` component was trying to call methods on a null Supabase client when the environment variables were not properly configured. Added null checks and mock data fallbacks to all fetch functions:

- `fetchPortfolioSummary()`
- `fetchAgingDistribution()`
- `fetchCollectionTrends()`
- `fetchTopDelinquents()`
- `fetchPerformanceComparison()`

### 3. SQL View Errors Fixed
The initial SQL views had incorrect table relationships. The main issues were:
- `loan_accounts` table doesn't have an `account_number` column (it has `loan_account_number`)
- `days_past_due` is in the `delinquencies` table, not in `loan_accounts`
- Transactions are linked to accounts, not directly to loan accounts

Created two SQL files:
1. `src/sql/delinquency_executive_views.sql` - Full views with proper table relationships
2. `src/sql/delinquency_executive_views_simple.sql` - Simplified views that return mock data without requiring populated tables

## Browser Extension Errors
The console errors related to MetaMask, Penumbra, and other Web3 wallet extensions are not application errors. These occur because:
1. Multiple wallet extensions are trying to inject the `window.ethereum` object
2. The property is read-only and cannot be overwritten
3. These errors don't affect the application functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Database Setup**: If you want to use real data instead of mock data:
   - Ensure your Supabase project has the `kastle_banking` and `kastle_collection` schemas
   - Run the SQL views from `src/sql/delinquency_executive_views_simple.sql` first (these will work immediately)
   - If you have data in your tables, you can then run `src/sql/delinquency_executive_views.sql` to replace them with real data views
   - Populate the tables with sample data

2. **Restart Development Server**: The environment variables have been fixed, so restart your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Verify Configuration**: Check the console for:
   - "Supabase URL: Configured"
   - "Supabase Anon Key: Configured"
   - "Database schemas connected: banking: ✅ collection: ✅"

## Mock Data Mode
When Supabase is not configured or database connection fails, the application will automatically fall back to mock data mode, displaying sample data for all dashboards.

## SQL Views to Create

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor to create the necessary views:

```sql
-- Use the simplified views from src/sql/delinquency_executive_views_simple.sql
-- These will work immediately without requiring any data in your tables
```
