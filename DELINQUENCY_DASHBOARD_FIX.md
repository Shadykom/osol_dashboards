# Delinquency Executive Dashboard Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Environment Variable Configuration
The `.env` file had the `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` split across multiple lines, which caused it to be read incorrectly. This has been fixed by putting the entire key on a single line.

### 2. Null Supabase Client Handling
The `DelinquencyExecutiveDashboard` component was trying to call methods on a null Supabase client when the environment variables were not properly configured. Added null checks and mock data fallbacks to all fetch functions:

- `fetchPortfolioSummary()`
- `fetchAgingDistribution()`
- `fetchCollectionTrends()`
- `fetchTopDelinquents()`
- `fetchPerformanceComparison()`

### 3. Missing Database Views
Created SQL file `src/sql/delinquency_executive_views.sql` with the necessary database views:
- `executive_delinquency_summary`
- `aging_distribution`
- `collection_rates`
- `top_delinquent_customers`

## Browser Extension Errors
The console errors related to MetaMask, Penumbra, and other Web3 wallet extensions are not application errors. These occur because:
1. Multiple wallet extensions are trying to inject the `window.ethereum` object
2. The property is read-only and cannot be overwritten
3. These errors don't affect the application functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Database Setup**: If you want to use real data instead of mock data:
   - Ensure your Supabase project has the `kastle_banking` and `kastle_collection` schemas
   - Run the SQL views from `src/sql/delinquency_executive_views.sql`
   - Populate the tables with sample data

2. **Restart Development Server**: The environment variables have been fixed, so restart your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Verify Configuration**: Check the console for:
   - "Supabase URL: Configured"
   - "Supabase Anon Key: Configured"
   - "Database schemas connected: banking: ✅ collection: ✅"

## Mock Data Mode
When Supabase is not configured or database connection fails, the application will automatically fall back to mock data mode, displaying sample data for all dashboards.
