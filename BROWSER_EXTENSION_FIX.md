# Browser Extension Conflict and White Screen Fix

## Issues Identified

1. **Browser Extension Conflicts**: Multiple crypto wallet extensions (MetaMask, Polkadot, Namada, etc.) were trying to inject their scripts into the page, causing conflicts with the `window.ethereum` property.

2. **React Minified Error #310**: This error occurs when React hooks are called outside of a component or in an incorrect order.

3. **Failed Data Loading**: The application was showing a white screen because data fetching was failing due to missing Supabase credentials.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Extension Blocker Script
Created `public/extension-blocker.js` to prevent browser extensions from interfering with the application:
- Blocks modification of `window.ethereum` and other crypto-related properties
- Filters out extension messages via postMessage
- Loaded before any other scripts in `index.html`

### 2. Dashboard Component Improvements
Updated `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`:
- Added proper initialization state management
- Implemented error handling with fallback to mock data
- Added loading states to prevent React hook errors
- Ensured hooks are called consistently

### 3. Mock Data Mode
Enhanced the data layer to support mock data when Supabase is not configured:
- Updated `src/lib/supabase.js` to detect missing credentials and enable mock mode
- Added `isMockMode` flag to indicate when using mock data
- Created mock Supabase client that returns empty results without errors

### 4. Service Layer Updates
Updated all service methods to return mock data when in mock mode:
- `DashboardService`: Added mock data for KPIs, transactions, analytics
- `CustomerService`: Added mock data for customer analytics
- Ensures the application works without a configured database

### 5. Environment Configuration
Created `.env.local` with:
- Placeholder Supabase credentials
- `VITE_ENABLE_MOCK_DATA=true` to explicitly enable mock mode
- Configuration for API timeouts and feature flags

## How It Works

1. The extension blocker script runs first, preventing browser extensions from injecting code
2. The application checks for valid Supabase credentials
3. If credentials are missing or mock mode is enabled, it uses mock data
4. The Dashboard component handles loading states and errors gracefully
5. Users see the dashboard with sample data instead of a white screen

## Testing

The application now:
- Loads successfully even without database configuration
- Shows mock data on the dashboard
- Handles browser extension conflicts gracefully
- Provides proper loading and error states

## Next Steps

To connect to a real database:
1. Update `.env.local` with actual Supabase credentials
2. Set `VITE_ENABLE_MOCK_DATA=false`
3. Ensure the database schema matches the expected structure
4. Restart the development server
