# Enhanced Dashboard Project

This project implements an enhanced banking dashboard based off the system design documented in the provided markdown files.

## Project Structure

The core of the dashboard lives inside the `src` directory and follows a typical React+Vite layout. The following high‑level areas are included:

```
enhanced_dashboard/
├── src/
│   ├── components/          # Generic reusable React components
│   │   ├── dashboard/       # Dashboard‑specific components (widgets, filters, tables, reports)
│   │   └── ui/              # Low level UI primitives (Button, Card, etc.)
│   ├── config/              # Configuration for charts, tables and widget catalog
│   ├── contexts/            # React context providers (global filters)
│   ├── hooks/               # Reusable hooks (caching, realtime updates)
│   ├── pages/               # Top level pages (Dashboard, Detail, Reports)
│   ├── services/            # Data access services for widgets and reports
│   └── utils/               # Date filters, formatting and report generation
└── package.json            # Dependencies
```

This project is a skeleton and does not attempt to run a full application in this environment.  Instead it lays out the directory structure and populates files with the logic extracted from the provided documentation.  You can copy these files into your existing React/Vite project and wire them up accordingly.
