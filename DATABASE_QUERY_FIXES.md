# Database Query Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Branches Table Query (400 Error)**
- **Issue**: Query was using `'kastle_banking.branches'` string instead of TABLES constant
- **Fixed in**: `/workspace/src/services/branchReportService.js`
- **Changes**: 
  - Changed `.from('kastle_banking.branches')` to `.from(TABLES.BRANCHES)`
  - Fixed in both `getBranches()` and `getBranchReport()` methods

### 2. **Products Table Query (404 Error)**
- **Issue**: Query was using `'products'` instead of schema-qualified name
- **Fixed in**: `/workspace/src/services/productReportService.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Changed `.from('products')` to `.from(TABLES.PRODUCTS)` in three locations:
    - `getProducts()` method
    - `getProductReport()` method  
    - `getProductComparison()` method

### 3. **Collection Officers Query (404 Error)**
- **Issue**: Query was looking for non-existent officer type 'SPECIALIST'
- **Fixed in**: `/workspace/src/services/specialistReportService.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Changed `.eq('officer_type', 'SPECIALIST')` to `.in('officer_type', ['CALL_AGENT', 'FIELD_AGENT', 'SENIOR_COLLECTOR', 'TEAM_LEAD'])`
  - Changed `.from('kastle_collection.collection_officers')` to `.from(TABLES.COLLECTION_OFFICERS)` in two locations

### 4. **Branch Report Foreign Key Error**
- **Issue**: Supabase couldn't find relationship between loan_accounts and customers tables
- **Fixed in**: `/workspace/src/services/branchReportService.js`
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed complex join syntax that was causing issues
  - Split the query into multiple steps:
    1. First get customers for the branch
    2. Then get loan accounts for those customers
    3. Fetch products and customer details separately
    4. Merge the data in JavaScript
  - This avoids the foreign key relationship issue

### 5. **Collection Officers Branch Query**
- **Issue**: Direct table reference instead of using TABLES constant
- **Fixed in**: `/workspace/src/services/branchReportService.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Changed `.from('kastle_collection.collection_officers')` to `.from(TABLES.COLLECTION_OFFICERS)` in `getBranchOfficerPerformance()`

## Root Cause

The main issues were:
1. **Inconsistent table references** - Some queries used direct strings instead of the TABLES constants
2. **Invalid filter values** - Querying for officer types that don't exist in the database
3. **Complex join syntax** - Supabase was having trouble with nested foreign key relationships

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Always use TABLES constants** - This ensures consistent schema-qualified table names
2. **Validate filter values** - Make sure enum values like officer types match what's in the database
3. **Simplify complex queries** - Break down complex joins into multiple simpler queries when Supabase has issues
4. **Handle errors gracefully** - The code already had mock data fallbacks which helped during debugging

## Testing

After these fixes, the application should no longer show the following errors:
- 400 errors for branches queries
- 404 errors for products queries  
- 404 errors for collection_officers queries
- Foreign key relationship errors

The application will now correctly query all tables using their schema-qualified names and valid filter values.
