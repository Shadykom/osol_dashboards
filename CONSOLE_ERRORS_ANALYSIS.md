# Console Errors Analysis and Solutions

## Overview
This document analyzes the console errors you're experiencing and provides solutions for each issue.

## Error Categories

### 1. Database Error (Critical - Application Breaking)

**Error:**
```
GET https://bzlenegoilnswsbanxgb.supabase.co/rest/v1/collection_officers?select=officer_id%2Cofficer_name%2Cofficer_type%2Cteam_id&status=eq.ACTIVE&order=officer_name.asc 404 (Not Found)
relation "public.collection_officers" does not exist
```

**Cause:** The application is trying to query `collection_officers` table in the public schema, but the table actually exists in the `kastle_collection` schema.

**Solution:** Fixed by updating all references from `'collection_officers'` to `TABLES.COLLECTION_OFFICERS` which correctly references `'kastle_collection.officers'`.

**Files Updated:**
- `src/services/collectionService.js` - All 4 instances have been fixed

### 2. Browser Extension Conflicts (Non-Critical)

These errors are caused by various browser extensions trying to inject their code into your page:

#### MetaMask Extension
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property ethereum of #<Window> which has only a getter
```
**Cause:** Multiple wallet extensions (MetaMask, Coinbase, etc.) are trying to set the `window.ethereum` property which is already defined.

#### Other Extension Errors
- Penumbra wallet extension
- Various crypto wallet extensions
- Edge Copilot extension

**Solutions:**
1. **For Development:** These errors don't affect your application functionality. You can ignore them.
2. **To Clean Console:** Disable browser extensions while developing, or use an incognito/private window.
3. **For Production:** Add this to your index.html to prevent some injection conflicts:

```html
<script>
  // Prevent extension conflicts
  if (typeof window.ethereum !== 'undefined') {
    Object.defineProperty(window, 'ethereum', {
      configurable: false,
      enumerable: true,
      writable: false,
      value: window.ethereum
    });
  }
</script>
```

### 3. Chrome Extension Invalid URL
```
GET chrome-extension://invalid/ net::ERR_FAILED
```
**Cause:** An extension is trying to load an invalid resource.
**Solution:** This is a browser/extension issue, not your application. Can be ignored.

## Summary of Fixes Applied

1. **Database Query Fix:** Updated `collectionService.js` to use the correct schema-qualified table name for collection_officers.
2. **No changes needed for browser extension errors** as they don't affect application functionality.

## Testing the Fix

1. Refresh your application
2. The database error should be resolved
3. The SpecialistLevelReport should now load properly
4. Browser extension warnings will still appear but won't affect functionality

## Prevention for Future

1. Always use the `TABLES` constant when referencing database tables
2. Use schema-qualified table names in Supabase queries
3. Consider adding a linter rule to catch direct table name strings
