# Vercel Build Fix - Duplicate Export Error

## âœ… Issue Fixed

### Error:
```
Multiple exports with the same name "ExecutiveDashboard"
/vercel/path0/src/pages/ExecutiveDashboard.jsx:493:9
```

### Root Cause:
The `ExecutiveDashboard` component was being exported twice:
1. As a named export in the function declaration: `export function ExecutiveDashboard() {`
2. Again at the end of the file: `export { ExecutiveDashboard };`

### Solution:
Removed the duplicate export at the end of the file, keeping only the export in the function declaration.

### Changes Made:
```diff
// src/pages/ExecutiveDashboard.jsx
    </div>
  );
}
-
-export { ExecutiveDashboard };
```

## ðŸš€ Build Should Now Succeed

The Vercel build should now complete successfully. The modern sidebar integration is complete and ready for deployment.

### Other Components Checked:
- âœ… CustomDashboard - Single export (correct)
- âœ… OperationsDashboard - Single export (correct)
- âœ… Customers - Has both named and default export of same component (valid)

No other duplicate export issues were found.
