# Schema Access Error Summary

## Root Cause

Your application is experiencing errors because:

1. **No tables in public schema**: Your database tables are organized in custom schemas (`kastle_banking` and `kastle_collection`) instead of the default `public` schema.

2. **Schemas not exposed**: These custom schemas are not exposed in your Supabase API settings, which means the Supabase client cannot access them properly.

3. **Foreign key syntax fails**: The code uses Supabase's foreign key relationship syntax (e.g., `collection_teams!team_id`) which requires the schemas to be exposed to work.

## The Errors You're Seeing

```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400
Error: Could not find a relationship between 'kastle_collection.collection_officers' and 'collection_teams' in the schema cache
```

This happens because Supabase is looking for these relationships in the `public` schema (which is empty) instead of your custom schemas.

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Enable Schemas in Supabase (Recommended - 5 minutes)

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Settings → API**
4. Find the **"Exposed schemas"** section
5. Add these schemas:
   - `kastle_banking`
   - `kastle_collection`
6. Click **Save**

**Result**: Your application will work immediately without any code changes.

### Solution 2: Use the Code Fixes (Already Applied)

I've already updated two critical functions that were causing immediate errors:
- `getSpecialists()` in `collectionService.js`
- `getSpecialists()` in `specialistReportService.js`

These now use manual joins instead of foreign key syntax, so they work even without exposed schemas.

### Solution 3: Move Tables to Public Schema (Not Recommended)

This would require significant database migration and is not recommended.

## What's Working vs What's Not

### ✅ Working
- Dashboard KPIs (they use simple queries without foreign key joins)
- Basic table queries without relationships

### ❌ Not Working (until schemas are exposed)
- Specialist reports with team relationships
- Collection cases with related customer/loan data
- Any query using the `!` foreign key syntax

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Enable the schemas in Supabase Dashboard (Solution 1)
2. **If you can't access Supabase Dashboard**: More code fixes will be needed for other failing queries
3. **Long-term**: Consider implementing RPC functions for complex queries

## Testing

After enabling schemas, test with this in your browser console:

```javascript
// This should work after enabling schemas
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('kastle_collection.collection_officers')
  .select('*, collection_teams!team_id(*)')
  .limit(1);

console.log(error ? 'Still broken' : 'Fixed!', error || data);
```
