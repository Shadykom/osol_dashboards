# Reports Health Check Summary

## Overview
I've created a comprehensive health check system to verify all reports in the application are working properly and fetching data from the database correctly.

## Reports Checked

### 1. Main Reports Page (`/reports`)
- **Location**: `src/pages/Reports.jsx`
- **Services Used**: 
  - `comprehensiveReportService` - Handles financial, regulatory, customer, and risk reports
  - `reportGenerator` - Generates PDF and Excel exports
  - `emailService` - Handles email scheduling and sending
- **Report Categories**:
  - Financial Reports (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, etc.)
  - Regulatory Reports (SAMA Monthly, Basel III, AML/CFT, etc.)
  - Customer Reports (Acquisition, Segmentation, Satisfaction, etc.)
  - Risk Reports (Credit Risk, Market Risk, Liquidity Risk, etc.)

### 2. Collection Reports (`/collection/reports`)
- **Location**: `src/pages/CollectionReports.jsx`
- **Service**: `CollectionService`
- **Features**:
  - Collection summary reports
  - Officer performance reports
  - Team performance reports
  - Collection analytics with trends
  - Channel effectiveness analysis

### 3. Specialist Level Report (`/collection/specialist-report`)
- **Location**: `src/pages/SpecialistLevelReport.jsx`
- **Service**: `specialistReportService`
- **Features**:
  - Individual specialist performance metrics
  - Portfolio analysis
  - Collection activities tracking
  - Promise to pay (PTP) management

## Known Issues Found

### Database Schema Issues
The following tables are missing from the database:
1. `collection_cases` - Required for collection case management
2. `daily_collection_summary` - Required for collection analytics
3. `collection_officers` - Required for officer management
4. `collection_buckets` - Required for delinquency bucket management
5. `report_schedules` - Required for scheduled report functionality

### Column Name Mismatches
- The code references `amount` column but the actual column in transactions table is `transaction_amount`

## Health Check Tool Created

I've created a new health check page at `/reports-health-check` that:
1. Tests database connectivity
2. Verifies all required tables exist
3. Tests each report service functionality
4. Provides clear error messages and fix instructions

### How to Use the Health Check
1. Navigate to `/reports-health-check` in your browser
2. The page will automatically run all tests
3. Review the results to see which reports are working and which have issues
4. If issues are found, follow the provided fix instructions

## Fix Instructions

### To Fix Database Issues
Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
./run_reports_fix_unified.sh
```

This script will:
1. Create all missing collection tables
2. Create the report_schedules table
3. Fix column mapping issues
4. Set proper permissions

### Manual Database Fix (if script fails)
If the script fails, you can manually apply the fixes:
```bash
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres < fix_reports_errors_unified_schema.sql
```

## Testing Results

### Working Reports
- Financial reports (with mock data if tables are missing)
- Basic report generation functionality
- PDF and Excel export capabilities

### Reports Requiring Database Fix
- Collection reports (all types)
- Officer performance reports
- Team performance reports
- Scheduled reports functionality

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**: Run the database fix script to create missing tables
2. **Data Population**: After creating tables, populate them with test data for better testing
3. **Monitoring**: Use the health check page regularly to ensure all reports remain functional
4. **Error Handling**: The application handles missing tables gracefully but shows mock data

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/pages/ReportsHealthCheck.jsx` - New health check component
- `src/App.jsx` - Added route for health check page
- This summary document

## Next Steps
1. Run the database fix script
2. Test all reports again using the health check page
3. Populate tables with sample data if needed
4. Monitor for any new issues
