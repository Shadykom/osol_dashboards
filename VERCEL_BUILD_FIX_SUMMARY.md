# Vercel Build Fix Summary

## Issue
The Vercel deployment was failing with the error:
```
Error: Build "src" is "index.html" but expected "package.json" or "build.sh"
```

This occurred because the `vercel.json` configuration was incorrectly set up for a static site instead of a Vite-based React application.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated vercel.json
Changed from:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "./index.html",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": { "distDir": "dist" }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

To:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "pnpm install && pnpm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Key Changes
- Removed the deprecated `builds` configuration
- Added proper `buildCommand` that installs dependencies and builds the project
- Specified `outputDirectory` as "dist" where Vite outputs the built files
- Changed `routes` to `rewrites` for proper SPA routing support

### 3. Created Documentation
- **ROUTES_SUMMARY.md**: Documents all application routes
- **VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive deployment guide
- **.env.example**: Example environment variables file

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push these changes to your repository
2. In your Vercel project settings, add the required environment variables:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `VITE_APP_VERSION`
   - `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
   - `VITE_ENABLE_MOCK_DATA`
3. Trigger a new deployment

The build should now complete successfully and all routes will work properly with client-side routing.
