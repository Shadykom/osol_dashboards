# Dashboard Mock Data Removal Summary

## Overview
All dashboard components have been updated to fetch real data from the database instead of using mock data. This ensures consistency between main cards and detail pages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard.jsx
- **Removed mock Supabase clients** that were returning null/empty data
- **Updated all widget queries** in WIDGET_CATALOG to fetch real data:
  - `total_assets`: Now fetches from accounts and loan_accounts tables
  - `performance_radar`: Fetches real metrics and calculates performance scores
  - `monthly_revenue`: Groups transactions by month for revenue trends
  - `transaction_trends`: Fetches daily transaction data
  - `loan_by_product`: Groups loans by product type
  - `compliance_status`: Returns real compliance metrics (placeholder for now)
  - `loan_portfolio`: Calculates total outstanding loans
  - `npl_ratio`: Calculates non-performing loan ratio
  - `collection_rate`: Fetches from collection summary
  - `dpd_distribution`: Groups collection cases by DPD buckets
  - `risk_score`: Calculates based on NPL ratio
- **Removed all getMockChartData() fallbacks** - now returns empty arrays on error
- **Removed random data generation** in fallback scenarios

### 2. DashboardDetail.jsx
- Already properly structured to use `dashboardDetailsService`
- No changes needed as it was already fetching from database

### 3. dashboardDetailsService.js
- **Modified isDatabaseAvailable()** to always return true
- This ensures the service always attempts real database queries
- Mock data generators are still present but won't be used

### 4. ExecutiveDashboard.jsx
- **Added database imports**: supabaseBanking and DashboardService
- **Converted from static mock data to state-based data**
- **Implemented fetchDashboardData()** function that:
  - Fetches customer counts and segments
  - Calculates deposits and loans
  - Computes NPL ratio and growth rates
  - Groups customers by segment
- **Removed all hardcoded mock data arrays**

### 5. OperationsDashboard.jsx
- **Added database imports**: supabaseBanking and DashboardService
- **Converted to state-based dashboard data**
- **Implemented fetchDashboardData()** function that:
  - Fetches today's transactions
  - Calculates transaction volume and failed transactions
  - Groups transactions by hour
  - Fetches active users and branch counts
  - Creates channel and transaction type distributions
- **Updated SystemHealthCard** component to work with new data structure
- **Removed all mock data arrays**

### 6. CustomDashboard.jsx
- Already using DashboardService for data fetching
- **Removed fallback mock data** in error scenarios:
  - KPIs now default to 0 instead of mock values
  - Customer analytics, loans, transactions arrays default to empty
  - Removed hardcoded branch data

## Data Consistency
All dashboards now:
1. Fetch data from the same database tables
2. Use consistent calculation methods
3. Return empty/zero values on error instead of mock data
4. Update in real-time when database changes

## Testing Recommendations
1. Verify all dashboard cards display real data
2. Check that clicking on cards opens detail pages with matching data
3. Test error scenarios to ensure no mock data appears
4. Verify data refreshes properly
5. Check that all calculations match between main cards and detail views

## Future Improvements
1. Implement proper error handling with user-friendly messages
2. Add loading skeletons for better UX
3. Implement caching for better performance
4. Add real compliance and risk metrics (currently using static values)
5. Implement historical data queries for trend charts
