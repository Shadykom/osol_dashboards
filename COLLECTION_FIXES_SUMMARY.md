# Collection Overview Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Schema Column Reference Errors
**Problem**: The application was trying to access columns that don't exist in the kastel_banking schema:
- `accounts.account_type` → should be `accounts.account_type_id` with join to `account_types`
- `transactions.transaction_type` → should be `transactions.transaction_type_id` with join to `transaction_types`

**Solution**: Updated all database queries to use proper foreign key references and include appropriate joins.

### 2. Collection Service Schema References
**Problem**: Collection service was using incorrect schema references for related tables.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated `CollectionService.getCollectionCases()` to use proper table aliases
- Fixed relationship queries to use correct column references
- Updated all related data queries to use the kastel_banking schema properly

### 3. Enhanced Dashboard Service Schema Issues
**Problem**: The enhanced dashboard details service was still using old column names.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated `account_type` references to use `account_type_id` with joins to `account_types` table
- Fixed all queries to include proper foreign key relationships
- Added proper error handling for missing schema elements

### 4. Collection Overview UI Improvements
**Problem**: The collection overview page lacked interactivity and detailed views.

**Enhancements**:
- Made all KPI cards clickable with hover effects
- Added visual indicators for trends and changes
- Improved error handling with fallback data
- Enhanced styling with modern UI components

### 5. Detail View Pages
**New Feature**: Created comprehensive detail pages for each collection overview card:
- Total Cases detail view with status breakdown
