# Dashboard Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Connection
- Added `.env` file with Supabase credentials:
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://bzlenegoilnswsbanxgb.supabase.co`
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` configured with the provided anon key
- Verified that the `kastle_banking` schema is exposed and accessible
- Created a test script to verify database connectivity

### 2. Filter Functionality
Fixed the dashboard filters to properly query data based on selected filters:

#### Updated Widgets to Accept Filters:
- **total_assets**: Now filters by branch
- **active_accounts**: Filters by branch and product type
- **customer_growth**: Filters by customer segment
- **transaction_volume**: Filters by date range and branch
- **transaction_trends**: Filters by date range and branch
- **account_types_distribution**: Filters by branch and product type

#### Filter Parameters:
- **Date Range**: today, last_7_days, last_30_days, last_quarter, last_year
- **Branch**: all, riyadh, jeddah, dammam
- **Product Type**: all, savings, current, loan
- **Customer Segment**: all, vip, premium, standard

### 3. Navigation to Detail Pages
- Fixed widget click navigation to use the proper route: `/dashboard/detail/{section}/{widget}`
- This allows clicking on any dashboard widget to view detailed information

### 4. Data Loading from Database
- All widgets now properly query data from the Supabase database
- Fallback to mock data if database queries fail
- Proper error handling and loading states

## How to Use

1. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   npx vite --port 5173 --host
   ```

2. **Access the Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5173/dashboard
   - The dashboard will automatically load data from the database

3. **Use Filters**:
   - Click the "Filters" button to expand the filter panel
   - Select desired filters (date range, branch, product type, customer segment)
   - Click "Apply Filters" to update the dashboard data

4. **Navigate to Details**:
   - Click on any widget card to navigate to its detail page
   - The detail page will show more comprehensive information about that metric

## Database Schema
The application uses the `kastle_banking` schema with the following main tables:
- customers
- accounts
- transactions
- loan_accounts
- branches
- products
- collection_cases

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Database Connection**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/setup-supabase-schema.js
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure `.env` file exists with correct Supabase credentials
   - Restart the development server after changing `.env`

3. **Seed Sample Data**:
   - Use the Data Seeder component in the dashboard
   - Or run the seeding script directly

4. **Schema Not Exposed Error**:
   - Go to Supabase dashboard > Settings > API
   - Add "kastle_banking" to exposed schemas
   - Save and wait a few seconds
