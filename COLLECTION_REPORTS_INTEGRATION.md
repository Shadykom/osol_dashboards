# Collection Reports Integration Confirmation

## Overview
All three collection report user stories have been successfully integrated into the OSOL banking system with proper sidebar navigation and routing.

## What Was Updated

### 1. Sidebar Navigation Updates
The sidebar (`/src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx`) has been reorganized to display all three collection reports at the same level for better visibility:

- **Branch Level Report**
  - Route: `/collection/branch-report`
  - Icon: Building2
  - Description: "Compare collection performance across branches, identify underperformers and top performers"
  - Badge: NEW

- **Product Level Report**
  - Route: `/collection/product-report`
  - Icon: Package
  - Description: "Evaluate risk and collection performance by product for data-driven lending decisions"
  - Badge: NEW

- **Specialist Report**
  - Route: `/collection/specialist-report`
  - Icon: UserSearch
  - Description: "Track communication activities, contact efforts, and promises to pay for each specialist"
  - Badge: NEW

### 2. Routes Confirmed in App.jsx
All routes are properly configured in `/src/App.jsx`:
```jsx
<Route path="/collection/specialist-report" element={<SpecialistLevelReport />} />
<Route path="/collection/branch-report" element={<BranchReportPage />} />
<Route path="/collection/product-report" element={<ProductReportPage />} />
```

### 3. Page Components Structure
Each report has the proper component structure:

#### Branch Level Report
- Page: `/src/pages/collection/BranchReport.jsx`
- Component: `/src/components/dashboard/BranchLevelReport.jsx` (1,206 lines)
- Service: `/src/services/branchReportService.js`

#### Product Level Report
- Page: `/src/pages/collection/ProductReport.jsx`
- Component: `/src/components/dashboard/ProductLevelReport.jsx` (1,269 lines)
- Service: `/src/services/productReportService.js`

#### Specialist Report
- Page: `/src/pages/SpecialistLevelReport.jsx` (2,402 lines - combined page/component)

## Navigation Hierarchy
