# Mobile Sidebar White Screen Fix

## Issue
The mobile sidebar was showing a white/blank screen when opened on mobile devices.

## Root Causes
1. Background color conflicts between the Sheet component and Sidebar component
2. CSS specificity issues causing styles to be overridden
3. Animation and rendering issues on mobile devices
4. Z-index layering problems

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Layout Component** (`src/components/layout/Layout.jsx`)
- Simplified the SheetContent background to solid colors
- Added explicit background color to the wrapper div
- Removed gradient backgrounds that were causing rendering issues

### 2. **Sheet Component** (`src/components/ui/sheet.jsx`)
- Removed unnecessary gap in the flex layout
- Ensured proper background color inheritance

### 3. **Sidebar Component** (`src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx`)
- Added explicit background colors for mobile sheet mode
- Ensured proper height and width on mobile devices

### 4. **CSS Fixes** (`src/index.css`)
- Added mobile-specific CSS rules to ensure visibility
- Fixed z-index layering issues
- Added hardware acceleration for smooth animations
- Ensured all content is visible with `opacity: 1` and `visibility: visible`
- Added specific animation keyframes for mobile
- Fixed background colors for both light and dark modes

## Key Changes

### CSS Mobile Fixes:
```css
/* Ensure sheet content is visible */
[data-slot="sheet-content"] {
  background-color: white !important;
}

/* Fix for sidebar inside sheet */
[data-slot="sheet-content"] .sidebar {
  height: 100vh !important;
  width: 100% !important;
}

/* Ensure content is visible */
[data-slot="sheet-content"] * {
  opacity: 1 !important;
  visibility: visible !important;
}
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Mobile Browser Testing:**
   - Open the application on a mobile device or use browser dev tools mobile view
   - Click the menu button in the header
   - The sidebar should slide in from the left with proper content visible

2. **Dark Mode Testing:**
   - Toggle dark mode on mobile
   - Ensure the sidebar has proper dark background colors

3. **Different Screen Sizes:**
   - Test on various mobile screen sizes (iPhone, iPad, Android devices)
   - Ensure the sidebar is visible and functional on all sizes

## Browser Compatibility
The fixes include:
- iOS Safari specific fixes
- Android Chrome optimizations
- Hardware acceleration for smooth animations
- Fallbacks for older browsers

## Performance Considerations
- Used CSS transforms for animations (GPU accelerated)
- Added `-webkit-transform: translateZ(0)` for iOS performance
- Minimized repaints with proper z-index layering
