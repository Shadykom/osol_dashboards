# Database Connection Error Fixes

## Summary of Issues Found

Based on the console logs and code analysis, there are several database connection issues:

### 1. ✅ Environment Variables Configured
The Supabase URL and anon key are properly configured:
- URL: `https://bzlenegoilnswsbanxgb.supabase.co`
- Anon Key: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...88wWYVWeBE`

### 2. ✅ Schema Already Exposed in Supabase API
The `kastle_banking` schema is already exposed and accessible via the REST API

### 3. ✅ Query Syntax Error Fixed (400 Bad Request)
**Error**: Column aliases using `as` in select queries cause malformed requests
**Location**: `src/services/specialistReportService.js` line 742-755
**Fix**: Removed column aliases from the select query

### 4. ✅ Misleading Database Connection Status Fixed
**Issue**: `{isConnected: false, hasDatabase: false}`
**Cause**: Legacy code checking for `window.db` which is not related to Supabase
**Fix**: Removed the misleading logs from App.jsx

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Created .env File
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://bzlenegoilnswsbanxgb.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImJ6bGVuZWdvaWxuc3dzYmFueGdiIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTMyODU3ODIsImV4cCI6MjA2ODg2MTc4Mn0.DtVNndVsrUZtTtVRpEWiQb5QtbhPAErSQ88wWYVWeBE
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:OSOL1a15975311@db.bzlenegoilnswsbanxgb.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

### 2. Fixed Query Syntax in specialistReportService.js
Removed column aliases from the select query:
```javascript
// Before (causing 400 error):
.select(`
  contacts_successful as calls_answered,
  ptps_obtained as promises_made,
  accounts_worked as cases_resolved,
  quality_score as customer_satisfaction_score
`)

// After (fixed):
.select(`
  contacts_successful,
  ptps_obtained,
  accounts_worked,
  quality_score
`)
```

### 3. Removed Misleading Database Connection Logs
Removed legacy `window.db` checks from App.jsx that were showing false connection status

## Real Issue: Empty Data

The actual issue is that the `officer_performance_metrics` table has no data for officer `OFF007`. The query is working correctly but returning an empty array `[]`.

## Required Manual Actions

### 1. Restart Development Server
To pick up the environment variables and code changes:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

### 2. Seed Performance Data (if needed)
If you need test data for the officer performance metrics, you may need to:
1. Check if there's a seeding script for `officer_performance_metrics`
2. Or manually insert test data for officer OFF007

## Other Observations

1. **Multiple GoTrueClient instances**: Warning about multiple auth client instances - not critical but should be investigated
2. **Ethereum conflict resolver**: Browser extension conflicts - not related to database issues
3. **Port disconnection/reconnection**: Browser extension communication issues - not related to database

## Testing After Fixes

1. The misleading database connection status logs have been removed
2. The 400 errors from column aliases have been fixed
3. The database connection is working correctly - verified with curl tests
4. The main issue is that there's no data in the `officer_performance_metrics` table for the requested officer

## Connection Details
- **Project URL**: https://bzlenegoilnswsbanxgb.supabase.co
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Schema**: kastle_banking (needs to be exposed)
- **Authentication**: Using anon key for client-side access
