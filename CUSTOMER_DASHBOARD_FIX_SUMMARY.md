# Customer Dashboard Fix Summary

## Issue
The dashboard detail page at `/dashboard/detail-new/customers/total_customers` was showing wrong data - it displayed "Total Assets" information instead of customer-related data.

## Root Cause
1. The `enhancedDashboardDetailsService.js` was not handling the customers section properly
2. The `DashboardDetailNew.jsx` component had hardcoded asset-related UI elements
3. Missing methods for fetching customer-specific data

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Dashboard Details Service (`src/services/enhancedDashboardDetailsService.js`)
- Added `getCustomersOverview()` method to fetch customer statistics
- Added `getCustomersTrendsData()` method to fetch historical customer trends
- Added `getCustomersRawData()` method to fetch detailed customer records
- Updated `getWidgetDetails()` to properly route customer section requests
- Added specific handling for `customers_total_customers` widget

### 2. Dashboard Detail Component (`src/pages/DashboardDetailNew.jsx`)
- Made the UI dynamically render based on section and widget type
- Updated Quick Stats Bar to show customer metrics for customer widgets
- Updated Overview tab to display customer-specific KPIs and charts
- Updated Trends tab to show customer growth trends instead of asset trends
- Updated Raw Data tab to display customer records instead of account/loan data
- Fixed default metadata title from hardcoded "Total Assets" to dynamic "Loading..."

## Key Features Added

### Customer Overview Metrics
- Total Customers count
- Active vs Inactive customers
- Customer segmentation by type (Individual, Corporate, VIP)
- New customers (last 30 days)
- Customer growth rate
- Active customer ratio

### Customer Trends
- Historical customer growth over 30 days
- Active customer trends
- New customer acquisition trends
- Daily growth rates

### Customer Raw Data
- Detailed customer records with:
  - Customer ID, Name, Type
  - Number of accounts
  - Total balance across accounts
  - Active/Inactive status
  - Join date

## Result
The customer dashboard detail page now correctly displays customer-specific data and analytics instead of asset information. The page dynamically adapts based on the section and widget being viewed, ensuring proper data display for all dashboard widgets.
