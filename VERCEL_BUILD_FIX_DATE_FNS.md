# Vercel Build Fix - Date-fns Version Conflict

## Issue
The Vercel build was failing with the following error:
```
npm error ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree
npm error Found: date-fns@4.1.0
npm error Could not resolve dependency:
npm error peer date-fns@"^2.28.0 || ^3.0.0" from react-day-picker@8.10.1
```

## Root Cause
- The project was using `date-fns@^4.1.0`
- `react-day-picker@8.10.1` only supports `date-fns` versions 2 or 3
- This created a peer dependency conflict that npm couldn't resolve

## Solution
Downgraded `date-fns` from version `^4.1.0` to `^3.6.0` (latest v3 version) in package.json:

```json
"dependencies": {
  // ...
  "date-fns": "^3.6.0",  // Changed from "^4.1.0"
  // ...
}
```

## Changes Made
1. Updated `package.json` to use `date-fns@^3.6.0`
2. Ran `pnpm install` to update the lock file
3. Verified the build works locally with `npm run build`

## Notes
- `react-day-picker` version 9 and later include `date-fns` as a direct dependency instead of a peer dependency, so upgrading to v9 would also solve this issue
- However, v9 has breaking changes that would require code updates
- Downgrading `date-fns` to v3 is the quickest fix that maintains compatibility

## Future Consideration
Consider upgrading to `react-day-picker` v9 in the future to:
- Get the latest features and bug fixes
- Remove the peer dependency requirement
- Use the latest `date-fns` version
