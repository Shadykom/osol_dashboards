# Sidebar Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Sidebar Toggle Issue
**Problem**: When closing the sidebar, it couldn't be reopened.
**Solution**: 
- Fixed the toggle functionality in `Layout.jsx` by creating a proper `handleMenuClick` function
- Ensured the menu button is always visible on desktop (removed `md:hidden` class from Header.jsx)
- The sidebar now properly toggles between collapsed and expanded states

### 2. Navigation Labels
**Problem**: Navigation items showing "navigation.specialist report" instead of just "Specialist Report"
**Solution**: 
- Added missing translations in both English and Arabic translation files:
  - `specialistReport`: "Specialist Report" / "تقرير المختص"
  - `collectionOperations`: "Collection Operations" / "عمليات التحصيل"
  - Added descriptions for all collection-related navigation items
  - Added missing loan-related translations

### 3. Removed New Loan Button
**Problem**: User requested removal of the "New Loan" button
**Solution**: 
- Removed the entire "Quick Actions" section from the sidebar that contained the "New Loan" button
- This cleaned up the sidebar interface
