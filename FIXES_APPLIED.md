# Fixes Applied to Osol Dashboard

## Issues Identified
1. **HTTP 406 errors** - All Supabase API calls failing due to schema configuration issues
2. **Missing logo file** - osol-logo.png returning 404 error
3. **Database schema mismatch** - Application trying to access tables with incorrect schema references

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Missing Logo (✅ COMPLETED)
- **Issue**: osol-logo.png was missing from public directory
- **Fix**: Copied `src/assets/osol-logo.png` to `public/osol-logo.png`
- **Result**: Logo 404 error resolved

### 2. Fixed Database Schema Configuration (✅ COMPLETED)
- **Issue**: Supabase client was configured with `db.schema: 'kastle_banking'` but table references were incorrect
- **Fix**: Updated `src/lib/supabase.js`:
  - Removed `db.schema: 'kastle_banking'` from client configuration
  - Updated TABLES constants to use full schema.table names (e.g., 'kastle_banking.customers')
- **Result**: Database queries should now work correctly

### 3. Application Code Review
- **Status**: Code structure looks good, no additional fixes needed
- **Services**: Dashboard and customer services are properly structured
- **Components**: React components are well-organized
- **Routing**: Navigation and routing are correctly implemented

## Expected Results
After these fixes:
- ✅ Logo should display correctly
- ✅ Database queries should work without 406 errors
- ✅ Dashboard should load with real data from Supabase
- ✅ All KPI cards should display actual values
- ✅ Charts and analytics should work properly

## Next Steps
1. Test the application to verify fixes
2. Check browser console for any remaining errors
3. Verify all dashboard functionality works correctly
