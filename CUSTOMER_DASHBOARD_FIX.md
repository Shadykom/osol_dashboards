# Customer Dashboard Fix Summary

## Issue
The customers dashboard was showing a React error #310 with the message:
```
Error: Minified React error #310; visit https://react.dev/errors/310 for the full message or use the non-minified dev environment for full errors and additional helpful warnings.
```

This error typically occurs when React hooks are called conditionally or in the wrong order, violating the Rules of Hooks.

## Root Cause
In the `src/pages/Customers.jsx` file, the `useTranslation` hook was being called inside helper functions (`getSegmentBadge` and `getKYCBadge`), which violates React's Rules of Hooks. Hooks must be called at the top level of React components, not inside nested functions or conditionals.

## Solution Applied

1. **Fixed Hook Usage in Customers Component**
   - Moved the `useTranslation` hook call out of the helper functions
   - Modified `getSegmentBadge` and `getKYCBadge` functions to accept the translation function `t` as a parameter
   - Updated the function calls to pass the `t` function from the parent component

2. **Updated Database Configuration**
   - Created/updated `.env` file with the correct Supabase credentials:
     - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://bzlenegoilnswsbanxgb.supabase.co`
     - Added the correct anonymous key for authentication
   - Created `.env.production` with the same configuration for production builds

3. **Resolved Build Issues**
   - Installed missing dependencies using pnpm
   - Successfully built the project without errors

## Changes Made

### src/pages/Customers.jsx
```diff
- function getSegmentBadge(segment) {
+ function getSegmentBadge(segment, t) {
    const variants = {
      'RETAIL': 'default',
      'PREMIUM': 'secondary',
      'HNI': 'destructive',
      'CORPORATE': 'outline'
    };
    
-   const { t } = useTranslation();
-   
    return <Badge variant={variants[segment] || 'default'}>{t(`common.${segment?.toLowerCase() || 'retail'}`)}</Badge>;
  }

- function getKYCBadge(status) {
+ function getKYCBadge(status, t) {
    const variants = {
      'APPROVED': 'default',
      'PENDING': 'secondary',
      'REJECTED': 'destructive'
    };
    
-   const { t } = useTranslation();
-   
    return <Badge variant={variants[status] || 'default'}>{t(`common.${status?.toLowerCase() || 'pending'}`)}</Badge>;
  }
```

And in the component usage:
```diff
- {getSegmentBadge(customer.segment)}
- {getKYCBadge(customer.kyc_status)}
+ {getSegmentBadge(customer.segment, t)}
+ {getKYCBadge(customer.kyc_status, t)}
```

## Verification
- The project now builds successfully without errors
- The React hooks are being called correctly according to the Rules of Hooks
- The database connection is properly configured with the provided credentials

## Next Steps
The application should now work correctly. The development server is running and the customers dashboard should no longer show the React error #310.
