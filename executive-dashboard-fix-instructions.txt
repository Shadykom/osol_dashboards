EXECUTIVE DASHBOARD FIX INSTRUCTIONS

ERROR: ReferenceError: executiveKPIs is not defined

SOLUTION:
The error occurs because executiveKPIs is not properly initialized in the component state.

1. In your ExecutiveDashboard component, make sure to initialize the state:

const [executiveKPIs, setExecutiveKPIs] = useState({
  totalRevenue: 0,
  totalCustomers: 0,
  activeLoans: 0,
  totalDisbursed: 0,
  totalCollected: 0,
  overdueAmount: 0,
  portfolioAtRisk: 0,
  averageLoanSize: 0,
});

2. Create an API endpoint /api/executive/kpis that returns this data structure

3. In the useEffect, fetch the data:

useEffect(() => {
  fetchExecutiveKPIs();
}, []);

const fetchExecutiveKPIs = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('/api/executive/kpis');
    setExecutiveKPIs(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
};

4. Make sure all references to executiveKPIs use the state variable

This should resolve the undefined error.
