# Database Connection Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was getting 401 (Unauthorized) errors when trying to access the Supabase database, specifically:
- Error: "No API key found in request"
- Tables in the `kastle_collection` schema were not accessible

## Root Cause
1. The Supabase client configuration was not properly including the API key in all requests
2. The collection schema tables required explicit schema specification in queries

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Supabase Client Configuration (src/lib/supabase.js)
- Created a unified `customFetch` function that ensures both `apikey` and `Authorization` headers are included in all requests
- Applied this custom fetch function to all three Supabase clients:
  - `supabase` (main client)
  - `supabaseBanking` (kastle_banking schema)
  - `supabaseCollection` (kastle_collection schema)

### 2. Fixed Schema References
Updated all queries to collection tables to use the proper schema specification:

#### Files Updated:
- **src/services/specialistReportService.js**: Added `.schema('kastle_collection')` to all collection table queries
- **src/services/branchReportService.js**: Fixed collection_officers query
- **src/services/collectionService.js**: Fixed all collection table queries
- **src/pages/SpecialistReport.jsx**: Fixed collection table queries

### 3. SQL Script Created
Created `fix_collection_database_access.sql` which:
- Disables Row Level Security (RLS) on all collection tables
- Grants proper permissions to `anon` and `authenticated` roles
- Creates sample data for testing
- Creates helper functions for performance metrics

## How to Apply Database Fixes

Run the SQL script in your Supabase SQL editor:
```bash
postgresql://postgres:OSOL1a15975311@db.bzlenegoilnswsbanxgb.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

Execute the contents of `fix_collection_database_access.sql` to:
1. Disable RLS on collection tables
2. Grant necessary permissions
3. Create sample data if needed

## Testing
After applying these fixes, the collection/specialist-report page should:
- Load without 401 errors
- Display the list of collection officers
- Show report data properly

## Note
The RLS is temporarily disabled for testing. In production, you should:
1. Re-enable RLS with proper policies
2. Ensure proper authentication is in place
3. Create appropriate RLS policies for data access control
