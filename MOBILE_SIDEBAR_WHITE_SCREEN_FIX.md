# Mobile Sidebar White Screen Fix

## Issue
The mobile sidebar was showing a white/empty screen when opened on mobile devices.

## Root Causes
1. The Sheet component was using `bg-background` CSS class which wasn't properly defined
2. Missing explicit background colors on the Sheet component
3. Potential z-index conflicts with the close button

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Layout.jsx
- Added explicit background gradient to SheetContent:
  ```jsx
  className="p-0 w-80 max-w-[85vw] border-0 overflow-hidden flex flex-col h-full bg-gradient-to-b from-gray-50 via-white to-gray-50 dark:from-gray-900 dark:via-gray-950 dark:to-gray-900"
  ```

### 2. Updated sheet.jsx
- Changed `bg-background` to explicit colors: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-950`
- Added z-50 to close button to ensure it's above content
- Fixed close button rounded corners from `rounded-xs` to `rounded-sm`

### 3. Cleaned up Sidebar.jsx
- Removed debug messages that were showing in production
- Kept the navigation items rendering logic intact

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Open the application on a mobile device or use browser dev tools (F12) and switch to mobile view
2. Click the menu/hamburger button in the header
3. The sidebar should slide in from the left with:
   - Proper gradient background (light gray in light mode, dark gray in dark mode)
   - All navigation items visible
   - Smooth animations
   - Working close button (X) in the top right
   - Auto-close when navigating to a new page

## Additional Notes
- The sidebar maintains its gradient background consistent with the desktop version
- Navigation items are properly displayed with all sections expanded by default on mobile
- The Sheet component now has explicit background colors to prevent white screen issues
