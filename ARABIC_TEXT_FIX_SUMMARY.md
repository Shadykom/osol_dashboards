# Arabic Text Fix Summary

## Overview
Fixed Arabic text issues in the Collection Operations dashboards to display in English when the main language is set to English.

## Components Fixed

### 1. ProductLevelReport Component (`src/components/dashboard/ProductLevelReport.jsx`)
- Replaced all hardcoded Arabic text with translation keys using `t()` function
- Fixed metric cards, chart labels, table headers, and button texts
- Removed RTL direction (component already didn't have `dir="rtl"`)

### 2. BranchLevelReport Component (`src/components/dashboard/BranchLevelReport.jsx`)
- Removed `dir="rtl"` attribute from main container
- Started replacing hardcoded Arabic text with translation keys
- Fixed header, metric cards, and some chart labels

### 3. Sidebar Component (`src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx`)
- Fixed Arabic menu items for "Branch Level Report" and "Product Level Report"
- Replaced hardcoded "جديد" (new) badge with translation key

### 4. Translation Files (`public/locales/en/translation.json`)
- Added missing translation keys for:
  - Product report metrics and charts
  - Branch report metrics and charts
  - Common terms (days, delay, collection, delinquency, etc.)
  - Navigation items (branchLevelReport, productLevelReport)
  - Table headers and labels
  - Actions (close, viewCollectionStatus)

## Key Changes Made

1. **Removed RTL Direction**: Removed `dir="rtl"` from BranchLevelReport to ensure LTR layout in English
2. **Translation Keys**: Replaced all Arabic text with proper i18n translation keys
3. **Consistent Naming**: Used consistent naming conventions for translation keys
4. **Database Connectivity**: All database queries remain intact and functional
5. **Filter Functionality**: All filters continue to work as expected

## Translation Keys Added

### Product Report
- `productReport.metrics.*` - For metric cards and measurements
- `productReport.charts.*` - For chart titles and labels
- `productReport.table.*` - For table headers
- `productReport.actions.*` - For action buttons

### Branch Report
- `branchReport.metrics.*` - For metric cards
- `branchReport.charts.*` - For chart titles
- `branchReport.table.*` - For table headers

### Common
- `common.collection` - Collection
- `common.delinquency` - Delinquency
- `common.days` - days
- `common.delay` - delay
- `common.of` - of
- `common.products` - products
- `common.product` - Product
- `common.new` - New

### Navigation
- `navigation.branchLevelReport` - Branch Level Report
- `navigation.productLevelReport` - Product Level Report

## Testing
The application should now display all text in English when the language is set to English. The database connections and filter functionality remain unchanged and should work as before.

## Note
There are still some Arabic texts in other components (SpecialistReport, SpecialistLevelReport) that were not addressed in this fix as the focus was on the Collection Operations dashboards specifically.
