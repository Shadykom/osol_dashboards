# Fixes Applied to Resolve Console Errors

## 1. Fixed Missing Logo Image (404 Error)
**Issue**: The logo was being referenced at `/src/assets/osol-logo.png` which doesn't exist in production.
**Fix**: Changed the path to `/osol-logo.png` in `src/components/layout/Header.jsx` since the logo is already in the public directory.

## 2. Fixed Supabase API 400 Errors
**Issue**: The application was querying `branch_id` on the customers table, but the column is actually named `onboarding_branch`.
**Fix**: Updated `src/services/dashboardService.js` to use `onboarding_branch` instead of `branch_id` for customer queries.

## 3. Fixed React Error #130 (Invalid Element Type)
**Issue**: The Reports component was trying to import `FilePdf` which doesn't exist in lucide-react.
**Fix**: Changed the import to `FileDown` in `src/pages/Reports.jsx`.

## 4. Database Schema Access Issue (Requires Manual Fix)
**Issue**: The application is trying to access tables as `kastle_banking.customers` but Supabase interprets this as looking for a table named `kastle_banking.customers` in the public schema.
**Solution**: The `fix_schema.sql` file needs to be executed on the Supabase database to create views in the public schema that properly reference the kastle_banking schema tables.

To apply the database fix, run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Execute the contents of fix_schema.sql in your Supabase SQL editor
```

## Summary
- ✅ Logo path fixed - image will now load correctly
- ✅ Branch query fixed - using correct column name
- ✅ React component error fixed - removed invalid import
- ⚠️ Database schema views need to be created by running fix_schema.sql in Supabase

After applying the database schema fix, all console errors should be resolved.
