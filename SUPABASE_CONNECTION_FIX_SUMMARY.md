# Supabase Connection Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was experiencing a 401 (Unauthorized) error when trying to fetch data from Supabase, specifically when querying the `collection_officers` table.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by incorrect schema specification in the database queries. The code was using both `.schema('kastle_collection')` and table names that already included the schema prefix (e.g., `kastle_collection.collection_officers`), resulting in double schema specification.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Verified that `.env` file contains the correct Supabase credentials:
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://bzlenegoilnswsbanxgb.supabase.co`
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is properly set

### 2. Schema Query Corrections
Fixed queries in multiple files to use the correct table references:

#### In `src/services/collectionService.js`:
- Changed from: `.schema('kastle_collection').from('collection_officers')`
- Changed to: `.from(COLLECTION_TABLES.COLLECTION_OFFICERS)`
- Added `COLLECTION_TABLES` to the imports
- Fixed similar issues for other tables like `collection_teams`, `officer_performance_summary`, etc.

#### In `src/pages/SpecialistReport.jsx`:
- Applied similar fixes for collection table queries

### 3. Permission Fixes
Fixed executable permissions for development tools:
- `chmod +x node_modules/.bin/vite`
- `chmod +x` for all esbuild executables

## Result
The application now successfully connects to Supabase and can query the collection tables without authentication errors. The development server is running properly at http://localhost:5173/.

## Key Learnings
1. When using Supabase clients with schema configuration, avoid double schema specification
2. Use consistent table reference patterns throughout the codebase
3. Maintain separate table constants for different schemas (TABLES vs COLLECTION_TABLES)
4. Ensure proper file permissions for node_modules executables in development environments
