# Collection Officers Table Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was throwing the error:
```
Error fetching specialists: column collection_officers.officer_name does not exist
```

## Root Cause
The issue was that the queries were trying to access tables without specifying the schema prefix. The `collection_officers` table exists in the `kastle_collection` schema, but the queries were not using the schema-qualified table names.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed specialistReportService.js
Updated all table references to include the schema prefix:
- `collection_officers` → `kastle_collection.collection_officers`
- `collection_teams` → `kastle_collection.collection_teams`
- `collection_cases` → `kastle_collection.collection_cases`
- `collection_interactions` → `kastle_collection.collection_interactions`
- `promise_to_pay` → `kastle_collection.promise_to_pay`
- `officer_performance_metrics` → `kastle_collection.officer_performance_metrics`

### 2. Fixed collectionService.js
Updated the `getSpecialists()` function to use the TABLES constants:
- `'collection_officers'` → `TABLES.COLLECTION_OFFICERS`
- `'collection_teams'` → `TABLES.COLLECTION_TEAMS`

## Verification
The table structure confirms that `officer_name` column exists:
```sql
create table kastle_collection.collection_officers (
  officer_id character varying(20) not null,
  officer_name character varying(200) not null,
  -- other columns...
)
```

## Result
The error should now be resolved as all queries are properly using schema-qualified table names.
