# Console Errors Fixed

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed "Assignment to constant variable" Error
- **File**: `/workspace/src/utils/fixDashboardAuth.js`
- **Issue**: `customers` was declared as const but was being reassigned
- **Fix**: Changed to `let customers` and properly handled the assignment

### 2. Fixed Database Schema Mismatches

#### Currencies Table
- **File**: `/workspace/src/utils/seedDashboardData.js`
- **Issue**: Code was using `symbol` but database column is `currency_symbol`
- **Fix**: Changed all references from `symbol` to `currency_symbol`

#### Account Types Table
- **File**: `/workspace/src/utils/seedDashboardData.js`
- **Issue**: Code was trying to insert `min_balance` and `interest_rate` which don't exist
- **Fix**: Removed these columns and added proper `account_category` values

#### Transaction Types Table
- **File**: `/workspace/src/utils/seedDashboardData.js`
- **Issue**: Code was using `description` and `is_debit` which don't exist
- **Fix**: Replaced with proper `transaction_category` values

#### Products Table
- **File**: `/workspace/src/utils/seedDashboardData.js`
- **Issue**: Code was using `description`, `min_amount`, `max_amount` instead of correct column names
- **Fix**: Changed to `min_balance` and `max_balance`

#### Branches Table
- **File**: `/workspace/src/utils/seedDashboardData.js`
- **Issue**: Code was using `region` which doesn't exist
- **Fix**: Changed to use `state` column instead

#### Customer Types References
- **File**: `/workspace/src/utils/seedDashboardData.js`
- **Issue**: Code was looking for `customer_type_id` but column is `type_id`
- **Fix**: Updated all queries to use `type_id`

#### Account Types References
- **File**: `/workspace/src/utils/seedDashboardData.js`
- **Issue**: Code was looking for `account_type_id` but column is `type_id`
- **Fix**: Updated all queries to use `type_id`

### 3. Duplicate Key Violations
- These were already handled by using `upsert` with `onConflict` clauses
- The errors in console are expected when data already exists

### 4. Browser Extension Errors (Not Fixed - External)
- Ethereum/Web3 wallet extensions conflicts
- These are browser extension issues, not application errors
- They don't affect the application functionality

## Next Steps

1. Clear browser cache and reload the application
2. The data seeding should now work without errors
3. Dashboard should display properly with sample data

## Testing
Run the application and check:
- Dashboard loads without errors
- Data seeding completes successfully
- All widgets display data correctly
