# Mobile Sidebar and Data Refresh Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Mobile Sidebar Empty Issue
The mobile sidebar was not displaying navigation items properly. The following fixes were implemented:

#### Changes in Sidebar.jsx:
- Added mobile detection state that properly resets search query on mobile to ensure items are visible
- Added useEffect hook to automatically close mobile sidebar when navigating to a new route
- Improved mobile state handling with forced re-render on mobile detection

#### Changes in Layout.jsx:
- Added location tracking to close mobile sidebar on route changes
- Improved Sheet component configuration with overflow-y-auto for better scrolling
- Added proper mobile sidebar close handler
- Added isMobileSheet prop to differentiate mobile behavior

### 2. Automatic Data Refresh on Dashboard Open
Implemented automatic data refresh when dashboards are opened:

#### Created useDataRefresh Hook (/workspace/src/hooks/useDataRefresh.js):
- Custom hook that handles automatic data refresh on component mount
- Supports refresh intervals for real-time data updates
- Handles dependencies for conditional refresh
- Shows toast notifications for user feedback
- Returns refresh function, loading state, and last refresh timestamp

#### Updated Dashboards:
1. **Executive Dashboard** (ExecutiveDashboard.jsx):
   - Added useDataRefresh hook with automatic refresh on mount
   - Shows "Executive Dashboard loaded" notification
   - Added refresh button with loading state
   - Displays last updated timestamp

2. **Field Collection Dashboard** (FieldCollectionDashboard.tsx):
   - Added useDataRefresh hook with 30-second auto-refresh interval
   - Refreshes when filters change (date, agent, region)
   - Added refresh button with spinning animation when loading
   - Shows last updated timestamp
   - No notifications for auto-refresh to avoid spam

3. **Main Dashboard** (Dashboard.jsx):
   - Integrated useDataRefresh hook
   - Replaced manual refresh logic with hook
   - Auto-refresh every 30 seconds when enabled
   - Refresh on filter changes

## Key Features Added

1. **Mobile Sidebar**:
   - Properly displays all navigation items on mobile
   - Automatically closes when navigating to a new page
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Proper overflow handling for long navigation lists

2. **Data Refresh**:
   - Automatic data loading when dashboard opens
   - Manual refresh button with loading state
   - Auto-refresh intervals for real-time dashboards
   - Last updated timestamp display
   - Toast notifications for user feedback
   - Dependency-based refresh (e.g., when filters change)

## Testing
To test the fixes:
1. Open the dashboard on a mobile device or use browser dev tools mobile view
2. Click the menu button to open the sidebar - all navigation items should be visible
3. Navigate to any page - the sidebar should automatically close
4. Open any dashboard - data should load automatically with a notification
5. Click the refresh button - data should reload with visual feedback
6. On Field Collection Dashboard - data auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
