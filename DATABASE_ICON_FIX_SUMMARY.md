# Database Icon Error Fix Summary

## Issue
The production build on Vercel was throwing the error:
```
ReferenceError: Database is not defined
```

This was happening when trying to use the `Database` icon from `lucide-react` in the minified production build.

## Root Cause
The issue was related to how Vite was handling the lucide-react icon imports during the production build process. The minification/bundling process was not properly resolving the Database icon import.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Created Centralized Icon Utility (`src/utils/icons.js`)
- Created a dedicated utility file for managing icon imports
- Provides fallback icons in case specific icons fail to load
- Exports icons with proper error handling

### 2. Updated Vite Configuration (`vite.config.js`)
- Added build optimizations for better handling of lucide-react
- Configured manual chunks to separate lucide-react into its own bundle
- Added lucide-react to optimizeDeps for better pre-bundling

### 3. Updated Component Imports
- Modified `DatabaseTest.jsx` to use centralized icon imports
- Modified `DataSeeder.jsx` to use centralized icon imports
- Both components now import icons from `@/utils/icons` instead of directly from lucide-react

## Files Modified
1. `src/utils/icons.js` - New file for centralized icon management
2. `vite.config.js` - Added build optimizations
3. `src/pages/DatabaseTest.jsx` - Updated icon imports
4. `src/components/dashboard/DataSeeder.jsx` - Updated icon imports

## Testing
After these changes:
1. The production build should no longer throw the "Database is not defined" error
2. Icons will have proper fallbacks if loading fails
3. The build process will handle lucide-react imports more efficiently

## Deployment
To deploy these fixes:
1. Commit all changes
2. Push to your repository
3. Vercel will automatically rebuild with the new configuration
4. The error should be resolved in the new deployment
