# Supabase Authentication Fix - COMPLETED âœ…

## Issue Resolved
The 401 (Unauthorized) errors have been successfully fixed by adding the correct Supabase anon key to your environment configuration.

## What Was Done

1. **Updated `.env` file** with your Supabase anon key:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImJ6bGVuZWdvaWxuc3dzYmFueGdiIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTMyODU3ODIsImV4cCI6MjA2ODg2MTc4Mn0.DtVNndVsrUZtTtVRpEWiQb5QtbhPAErSQ88wWYVWeBE
   ```

2. **Verified the connection** - Successfully connected to the database and queried data

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your development server** to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C if running)
   # Start it again
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **The application should now work properly** with real data from your Supabase database

## Additional Notes

- The "Multiple GoTrueClient instances" warning is non-critical and can be addressed later
- Row Level Security (RLS) appears to be properly configured for the anon role
- The application will now use real data instead of mock data
