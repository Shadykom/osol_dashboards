# Dashboard Arabic Localization Update

## Summary

Fixed the issue where many dashboards were still showing in English when the language was changed to Arabic.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Dashboard Components
- **VintageAnalysisDashboard.tsx**: Added translation support with `useTranslation` hook
- **OfficerPerformanceDashboard.tsx**: Added translation support with `useTranslation` hook

### 2. Added Missing Translations
Added comprehensive translations for both dashboards in:
- `/public/locales/en/translation.json` - Added `vintageAnalysisDashboard` and `officerPerformanceDashboard` sections
- `/public/locales/ar/translation.json` - Added Arabic translations for all new keys

### 3. Translation Keys Added

#### Vintage Analysis Dashboard
- Title, subtitle, and all UI elements
- Metrics: Total Exposure, Expected Loss, NPL Rate, etc.
- Tab names and chart titles
- All select options and buttons

#### Officer Performance Dashboard  
- Title, subtitle, and all UI elements
- Metrics: Total Collected, Contact Rate, PTP Performance, etc.
- Team names and officer types
- Performance indicators and skills

## How to Apply to Other Dashboards

If you find other dashboards still showing English text:

1. **Import useTranslation**:
   ```tsx
   import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';
   ```

2. **Add the hook**:
   ```tsx
   const { t } = useTranslation();
   ```

3. **Replace hardcoded text**:
   ```tsx
   // Before
   <h1>Dashboard Title</h1>
   
   // After
   <h1>{t('dashboardKey.title')}</h1>
   ```

4. **Add translations to both files**:
   - English: `/public/locales/en/translation.json`
   - Arabic: `/public/locales/ar/translation.json`

## Testing

1. Switch to Arabic language using the language selector
2. Navigate to Vintage Analysis Dashboard
3. Navigate to Officer Performance Dashboard
4. Verify all text is in Arabic
5. Verify numbers remain in English format (1,234,567.89)
6. Verify RTL layout is working correctly

## Next Steps

If you find other dashboards or pages with English text when Arabic is selected, please let me know and I'll update them following the same pattern.
