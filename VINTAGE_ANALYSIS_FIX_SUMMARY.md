# Vintage Analysis Dashboard Fix Summary

## Issue
The vintage analysis dashboard was throwing a runtime error:
```
ReferenceError: TrendingDown is not defined
```

## Root Cause
The `TrendingDown` icon component from `lucide-react` was being used in the VintageAnalysisDashboard.tsx file without being imported.

## Solution Applied

1. **Fixed Missing Import**: Added `TrendingDown` to the imports in `/workspace/src/pages/VintageAnalysisDashboard.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   import { 
     TrendingUp, TrendingDown, Calendar, DollarSign, AlertTriangle, Activity,
     BarChart3, PieChart, Target, Clock, Layers, Filter,
     Download, ChevronDown, Info, ArrowUpRight, ArrowDownRight
   } from 'lucide-react';
   ```

2. **Fixed Missing Dependency**: Installed the missing `@hello-pangea/dnd` package that was causing build failures:
   ```bash
   pnpm add @hello-pangea/dnd
   ```

## Database Configuration
The database connection string provided (`postgresql://postgres:OSOL1a159753@db.bzlenegoilnswsbanxgb.supabase.co:5432/postgres`) is already properly configured in the environment files:
- `.env` file contains the correct `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `DATABASE_URL` is also properly set

## Build Status
✅ The project now builds successfully without errors
✅ The vintage analysis dashboard should now work without the `TrendingDown is not defined` error

## Deployment
The fixed code is ready to be deployed to Vercel. The build process completes successfully with all dependencies properly resolved.
