- RTL-aware margin and padding utilities

#### C. Dashboard.jsx Updates
- Added mobile detection using `useIsMobile()` hook
- Implemented responsive padding and spacing
- Made section tabs horizontally scrollable on mobile
- Adjusted widget grid to stack on mobile (1 column)

### 3. Key Features Implemented

#### Mobile Features:
- ✅ Responsive grid layouts (1 column on mobile, up to 4-5 on desktop)
- ✅ Touch-friendly button sizes
- ✅ Horizontal scrolling for section tabs
- ✅ Condensed headers and navigation
- ✅ Mobile-optimized spacing and padding
- ✅ Responsive text sizes
- ✅ Stacked layouts for complex components

#### RTL Features:
- ✅ Automatic direction switching based on language
- ✅ Flipped layouts for Arabic
- ✅ Preserved English number formatting
- ✅ RTL-aware spacing and margins
- ✅ Proper text alignment
- ✅ RTL-compatible charts and graphs
- ✅ Flipped navigation and button groups

### 4. Usage Examples

#### Using Mobile Responsive Classes:
```jsx
const isMobile = useIsMobile();

<div className={cn(
  "grid gap-4",
  isMobile ? "grid-cols-1" : "md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4"
)}>
  {/* Content */}
</div>
```

#### Using RTL Classes:
```jsx
const rtl = useRTLClasses();

<div className={cn("flex items-center", rtl.flexRow)}>
  <span className={rtl.marginEnd(2)}>Text</span>
  <Icon className="h-4 w-4" />
</div>
```

### 5. Testing Recommendations

#### Mobile Testing:
1. Test on various screen sizes (320px, 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px)
2. Check touch interactions on actual mobile devices
3. Verify horizontal scrolling for tabs
4. Test landscape and portrait orientations

#### RTL Testing:
1. Switch language to Arabic and verify layout flips
2. Check that numbers remain in English format
3. Verify chart directions are correct
4. Test dropdown and dialog alignments
5. Ensure scrollbars appear on the correct side

### 6. Future Enhancements
- Add more granular breakpoints for tablets
- Implement gesture support for mobile navigation
- Add swipe gestures for tab navigation
- Enhance chart responsiveness with dynamic sizing
- Add more RTL-specific animations
- Implement language-specific font families

## Conclusion
The dashboard and detail pages are now fully mobile responsive and support complete RTL localization. The implementation uses modern React patterns, Tailwind CSS utilities, and follows best practices for internationalization.
