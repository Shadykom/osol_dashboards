# Dashboard Cards Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Widget Titles
**Problem**: Some dashboard cards were displaying without titles.
**Solution**: 
- Added missing `name` and `nameEn` properties to widgets in the WIDGET_CATALOG
- Updated the renderWidget function to use the calculated `widgetName` variable with proper fallbacks
- Changed from `{i18n.language === 'ar' ? widgetDef.name : widgetDef.nameEn}` to `{widgetName || 'Widget'}`

### 2. Data Loading Issues
**Problem**: Some cards were not loading data properly.
**Solution**:
- Verified all widgets have query functions
- Enhanced error handling in the widget data fetching process
- Added proper loading states and error states for individual widgets

### 3. Navigation Issues
**Problem**: All cards were opening the same detail page instead of their specific pages.
**Solution**:
- Fixed the navigation path to include both section and widget ID: `/dashboard/detail-new/${widget.section}/${widget.widget}`
- Updated the enhancedDashboardDetailsService to handle all widget types dynamically
- Exported WIDGET_CATALOG from Dashboard.jsx to make it accessible to the service

### 4. Data Consistency
**Problem**: Data shown in dashboard cards was not consistent with detail pages.
**Solution**:
- Updated the detail page to display dynamic titles using `{detailData.metadata?.title || widgetId}`
- Modified the overview tab to handle different widget types (KPI vs Chart)
- Enhanced the service to properly format data based on widget type
- Added proper data transformation for chart widgets
