# Specialist Report Error Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Browser Extension Conflicts**: Multiple crypto wallet extensions (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) trying to inject `window.ethereum` causing "Cannot redefine property: ethereum" errors
2. **Missing Database Views**: The specialist report was trying to query views that don't exist in the database
3. **Extension Communication Errors**: Various browser extensions failing to establish connections

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Ethereum Conflict Resolver
Created `/public/ethereum-conflict-resolver.js` to handle conflicts when multiple wallet extensions try to inject the ethereum provider:

- Intercepts `Object.defineProperty` calls to prevent redefinition errors
- Allows only the first ethereum provider to be set
- Logs warnings for subsequent attempts instead of throwing errors
- Must be loaded before any other scripts

### 2. Updated index.html
Added the conflict resolver script to load before any other scripts:

```html
<!-- Ethereum conflict resolver - must be loaded first -->
<script src="/ethereum-conflict-resolver.js"></script>
```

### 3. Database Views and Tables
Created `create_specialist_views.sql` with:

- **v_specialist_loan_portfolio**: View that joins collection cases with customer data and latest interactions
- **officer_performance_summary**: Table to store daily performance metrics for each officer
- **update_officer_performance_summary()**: Function to calculate and update performance metrics
- Sample data insertion for testing

## How to Apply the Database Changes

Run the following SQL script in your Supabase database:

```bash
# Via Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to SQL Editor in Supabase Dashboard
2. Copy the contents of create_specialist_views.sql
3. Run the script

# Or via psql
psql -h your-db-host -U your-db-user -d your-db-name -f create_specialist_views.sql
```

## Testing the Fix

1. Clear browser cache and reload the application
2. Navigate to `/collection/specialist-report`
3. The page should load without ethereum-related errors
4. The specialist report should display data properly

## Remaining Console Messages

Some console messages may still appear but are harmless:
- Extension connection warnings (from extensions trying to communicate)
- Port connection messages (normal extension behavior)
- These don't affect the application functionality

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always load conflict resolution scripts first
2. Test with common browser extensions enabled
3. Ensure database views exist before querying them
4. Add proper error boundaries in React components
