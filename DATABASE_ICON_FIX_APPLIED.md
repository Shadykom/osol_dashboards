# Database Icon Fix Applied

## Issue
The application was showing a "ReferenceError: Database is not defined" error in production builds. This was occurring at:
- `https://osol-dashboardsv1-zeta.vercel.app/assets/index-Di8z3rzU.js`

## Root Cause
The `Database` icon from `lucide-react` was being imported and used directly in:
1. `src/pages/OperationsDashboard.jsx` - line 495
2. `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - line 1202

During production builds, Vite's minification process was not properly resolving the direct `Database` import from lucide-react.

## Solution Applied
1. **Updated OperationsDashboard.jsx**:
   - Removed `Database` from the lucide-react import
   - Added `import { DatabaseIcon } from '@/utils/icons';`
   - Changed `<Database className="h-6 w-6 mb-2" />` to `<DatabaseIcon className="h-6 w-6 mb-2" />`

2. **Updated Dashboard.jsx**:
   - Added `import { DatabaseIcon } from '@/utils/icons';`
   - Changed `<Database className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />` to `<DatabaseIcon className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />`

3. **Additional Fix**:
   - Installed missing dependency `@hello-pangea/dnd` that was causing build failures

## Why This Works
The `src/utils/icons.jsx` file provides a centralized icon import system with fallbacks:
```javascript
export const DatabaseIcon = LucideIcons.Database || LucideIcons.Server || FallbackIcon;
```

This approach ensures that:
- Icons are properly resolved during the build process
- Fallback icons are available if the primary icon fails to load
- The production build can properly minify and bundle the icons

## Verification
- Build completed successfully with `pnpm run build`
- The production bundle no longer contains undefined `Database` references
- The application should now work correctly on Vercel deployment

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the updated build to Vercel
2. Verify that the error no longer appears in production
3. Consider applying the same pattern to any other direct lucide-react icon imports that might cause similar issues
