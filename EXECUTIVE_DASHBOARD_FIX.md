# Executive Dashboard Customer Count Fix

## Problem
The Executive Dashboard shows 0 customers even though there are 58 customers in the database.

## Root Causes Identified
1. The customer count queries might be returning `null` instead of the actual count
2. The `is_active` field referenced in the code might not exist in the customers table
3. The Supabase count queries with `{ count: 'exact', head: true }` might not be working properly

## Fixes Applied
The following changes have been made to `/src/pages/ExecutiveDashboard.jsx`:

1. **Added error logging** to all customer queries to identify issues
2. **Added fallback logic** - if count queries return null, fetch actual data and count the records
3. **Removed dependency on `is_active` field** - now considers all customers as active

## How to Verify
1. Open your browser and navigate to the Executive Dashboard
2. Open the browser developer console (F12)
3. Look for these console logs:
   - `"Customer data debug:"` - shows raw query results
   - `"Final customer counts:"` - shows the processed counts

## Additional Debugging
If customers still show as 0:

1. In the browser console, run: `window.testCustomerCount()`
2. Check the Network tab for failed API calls
3. Visit the `/diagnostic` page to test database connectivity

## Manual Testing
You can test the customer count directly in your browser console:
```javascript
// Import the test function (already loaded)
await window.testCustomerCount()
```

## Next Steps
If the issue persists:
1. Check Supabase dashboard for the actual table structure
2. Verify that the `kastle_banking.customers` table exists and has data
3. Check for any Row Level Security (RLS) policies that might be blocking access
