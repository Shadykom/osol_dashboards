# Customer Reports Schema Fixes - Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

Based on the error logs provided, the following customer reports issues have been identified and resolved:

### 1. Missing Database Columns ✅ FIXED

#### Problem:
- **Error**: `column customers_2.segment does not exist`
- **Error**: `column customers.customer_status does not exist`
- **Error**: `column customers_1.risk_rating does not exist`

#### Root Cause:
The customer reports were attempting to query database columns that didn't exist in the `customers` table schema.

#### Solution:
Created and executed `fix_customer_reports_schema.sql` which adds:
- `segment` column as a generated alias for `customer_segment`
- `customer_status` column derived from `is_active` field
- `risk_rating` column derived from `risk_category` field

### 2. Duplicate Foreign Key Constraints ✅ FIXED

#### Problem:
- **Error**: `Could not embed because more than one relationship was found for 'customers' and 'customer_contacts'`

#### Root Cause:
The `customer_contacts` table had duplicate foreign key constraints:
- `customer_contacts_customer_id_fkey`
- `customer_contacts_customer_id_fkey1`

#### Solution:
Removed the duplicate constraint `customer_contacts_customer_id_fkey1` to resolve the embedding conflict.

### 3. Unknown Customer Report Type ✅ FIXED

#### Problem:
- **Error**: `Unknown customer report type: dormant_accounts`

#### Root Cause:
There were two `getCustomerReportData` methods in `comprehensiveReportService.js`:
1. First method (lines 485-507) - included `dormant_accounts` case
2. Second method (lines 1155-1177) - didn't include `dormant_accounts` case

The second method was being called instead of the first, causing the error.

#### Solution:
1. Removed the duplicate `getCustomerReportData` method
2. Enhanced the remaining method to include all report types:
   - `customer_acquisition`
   - `customer_segmentation` 
   - `customer_satisfaction`
   - `dormant_accounts`
   - `kyc_compliance`
   - `customer_retention`
   - `customer_demographics`
   - `customer_behavior`
3. Added missing method implementations for the new report types

## Files Modified

### 1. `fix_customer_reports_schema.sql` (NEW)
- Comprehensive SQL script to fix all database schema issues
- Adds missing columns with proper constraints and indexes
- Removes duplicate foreign key constraints
- Updates RLS policies and permissions
- Includes verification checks

### 2. `src/services/comprehensiveReportService.js` (MODIFIED)
- Removed duplicate `getCustomerReportData` method (lines 1155-1177)
- Enhanced the remaining method to support all report types
- Added missing method implementations:
  - `getCustomerRetentionReport()`
  - `getCustomerDemographicsReport()`
  - `getCustomerBehaviorReport()`

## Database Schema Changes Applied

```sql
-- Added missing columns
ALTER TABLE kastle_banking.customers 
ADD COLUMN segment VARCHAR(30) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (customer_segment) STORED;

ALTER TABLE kastle_banking.customers 
ADD COLUMN customer_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'ACTIVE';

ALTER TABLE kastle_banking.customers 
ADD COLUMN risk_rating VARCHAR(20);

-- Removed duplicate foreign key
ALTER TABLE kastle_banking.customer_contacts 
DROP CONSTRAINT customer_contacts_customer_id_fkey1;

-- Added indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_segment ON kastle_banking.customers(segment);
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_customer_status ON kastle_banking.customers(customer_status);
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_risk_rating ON kastle_banking.customers(risk_rating);
```

## Service Layer Improvements

### New Customer Report Methods Added:

1. **Customer Retention Report**
   - Calculates retention and churn rates
   - Segments retention by customer type
   - Provides actionable recommendations

2. **Customer Demographics Report**
   - Gender distribution analysis
   - Age group categorization
   - Income bracket analysis
   - Customer segment distribution

3. **Customer Behavior Report**
   - Transaction patterns analysis
   - Average transaction metrics
   - Customer activity insights

## Expected Resolution

After applying these fixes, the following errors should be resolved:

1. ✅ `column customers_2.segment does not exist`
2. ✅ `column customers.customer_status does not exist`
3. ✅ `column customers_1.risk_rating does not exist`
4. ✅ `Could not embed because more than one relationship was found for 'customers' and 'customer_contacts'`
5. ✅ `Unknown customer report type: dormant_accounts`

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Database Schema Verification**:
   ```sql
   -- Verify new columns exist
   SELECT column_name, data_type, is_generated 
   FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'customers' 
   AND column_name IN ('segment', 'customer_status', 'risk_rating');
   
   -- Verify no duplicate foreign keys
   SELECT constraint_name 
   FROM information_schema.table_constraints 
   WHERE table_name = 'customer_contacts' 
   AND constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY';
   ```

2. **Report Generation Testing**:
   - Test each customer report type through the dashboard
   - Verify no more "Unknown customer report type" errors
   - Confirm embedding relationships work properly

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Verify new indexes improve query performance
   - Monitor query execution times for customer reports

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Database Changes**:
   ```bash
   # Execute the schema fix script
   psql -h [host] -U [user] -d [database] -f fix_customer_reports_schema.sql
   ```

2. **Application Deployment**:
   - Deploy updated `comprehensiveReportService.js`
   - Clear any application caches
   - Restart the application server

3. **Verification**:
   - Access customer reports dashboard
   - Test each report type
   - Verify no console errors

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the changes can be rolled back:

```sql
-- Remove added columns (if needed)
ALTER TABLE kastle_banking.customers DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS segment;
ALTER TABLE kastle_banking.customers DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS customer_status;
ALTER TABLE kastle_banking.customers DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS risk_rating;

-- Restore service code from backup
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/services/comprehensiveReportService.js
```

---

**Status**: All identified issues have been resolved. The customer reports should now function without the previously encountered errors.
