# Services Directory Schema Check Summary

## Status: âœ… All Good

All service files in `/src/services/` are already correctly configured to use the `kastle_banking` schema.

## Service Files Checked:

### âœ… Already Using Correct Schema (supabaseBanking/supabaseCollection):
1. **branchReportService.js** - Uses `supabaseCollection` and `supabaseBanking`
2. **collectionService.js** - Uses `supabaseCollection` and `supabaseBanking`
3. **customerService.js** - Uses `supabaseBanking`
4. **dashboardService.js** - Uses `supabaseBanking` and `supabaseCollection`
5. **productReportService.js** - Uses `supabaseCollection` and `supabaseBanking`
6. **reportService.js** - Uses `supabaseBanking` and `supabaseCollection`
7. **specialistReportService.js** - Uses `supabaseBanking` and `supabaseCollection`

### âœ… Don't Use Supabase:
1. **widgetService.js** - Uses fetch API, no Supabase
2. **dashboardTemplates.js** - Template definitions only
3. **earlyWarningService.js** - React component file (should probably be moved to components)

### ðŸ”§ Fixed Import Issues:
1. **mockCustomerService.js** - Fixed incorrect import of `formatApiResponse`
2. **mockDashboardService.js** - Fixed incorrect import of `formatApiResponse`

## Key Findings:

1. **All production service files are correctly configured** - They all use either `supabaseBanking` or `supabaseCollection` (which is aliased to `supabaseBanking`)

2. **No service files are using the public schema** - None of the services import or use the plain `supabase` client

3. **Mock services had minor import issues** - They were trying to import `formatApiResponse` from `@/lib/supabase` when it's actually defined locally in each service

## Conclusion:

The services directory is properly configured for the `kastle_banking` schema. No additional changes are needed for database queries in this directory.
