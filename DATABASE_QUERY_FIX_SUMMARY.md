# Database Query Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Foreign Key Relationship Errors
**Problem**: Supabase queries were failing with errors like:
```
"Could not find a relationship between 'collection_cases' and 'collection_officers' in the schema cache"
```

**Root Cause**: 
- The `collection_cases` table is in the `kastle_banking` schema
- The `collection_officers` table is in the `kastle_collection` schema
- Cross-schema foreign key relationships were not properly configured in Supabase

**Solution Applied**:
- Replaced complex join queries with separate queries
- Manually enriched data by fetching related records separately
- Created lookup maps to associate related data

### 2. Files Updated

#### `/workspace/src/services/branchReportService.js`
- Fixed `getBranchReport` method to use separate queries instead of foreign key joins
- Changed from `supabaseCollection` to `supabaseBanking` for `collection_cases` table
- Added data enrichment logic to manually join related data

#### `/workspace/src/services/productReportService.js`
- Fixed `getProductReport` method with similar approach
- Updated all references to use enriched data instead of raw cases

#### `/workspace/src/services/collectionService.js`
- Fixed `getCaseDetails` method to fetch related data separately
- Added comprehensive data enrichment for all related tables

### 3. Ethereum Provider Conflict
**Problem**: Multiple crypto wallet extensions trying to inject `window.ethereum`

**Solution Applied** in `/workspace/public/ethereum-conflict-resolver.js`:
- Pre-defined the ethereum property before extensions load
- Enhanced error handling to prevent property redefinition errors
- Added logic to accept the first provider and ignore subsequent attempts

## Query Pattern Changes

### Before (Failing):
```javascript
const { data: cases } = await supabaseCollection
  .from('collection_cases')
  .select(`
    *,
    collection_officers!assigned_to (officer_id, officer_name),
    collection_interactions!case_id (*)
  `);
```

### After (Working):
```javascript
// 1. Get main data
const { data: cases } = await supabaseBanking
  .from('collection_cases')
  .select('*');

// 2. Get related data separately
const officerIds = [...new Set(cases.map(c => c.assigned_to))];
const { data: officers } = await supabaseCollection
  .from('collection_officers')
  .select('*')
  .in('officer_id', officerIds);

// 3. Enrich data manually
const enrichedCases = cases.map(c => ({
  ...c,
  assigned_officer: officers.find(o => o.officer_id === c.assigned_to)
}));
```

## Benefits
1. Queries now work reliably without foreign key errors
2. Better error handling and fallback behavior
3. More maintainable code with clear data flow
4. Ethereum provider conflicts resolved

## Testing Required
- Test branch reports functionality
- Test product reports functionality
- Test collection case details view
- Verify ethereum wallet extensions work without errors
