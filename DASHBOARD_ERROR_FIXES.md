# Dashboard Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Invalid Supabase API Key Error (401)
**Problem**: The application was getting "Invalid API key" errors when trying to access the Supabase API.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `.env` file with the correct Supabase credentials from `vercel.json`
- The API key is valid and working correctly

### 2. Authentication Auto-Creation Issue
**Problem**: The application was trying to automatically create users when no session was found, which was failing with API key errors.

**Solution**:
- Modified `src/utils/fixDashboardAuth.js` to not automatically create users
- Changed the authentication check to simply return false if no session exists
- Updated `fixDashboard()` to continue loading even without authentication

### 3. Schema-Qualified Table Names
**Problem**: Queries to `products` and `branches` tables were failing because they exist in the `kastle_banking` schema, not the public schema.

**Solution**:
- Updated `src/lib/supabase.js` TABLES constants to use schema-qualified names:
  - `products` → `kastle_banking.products`
  - `branches` → `kastle_banking.branches`
  - And all other kastle_banking and kastle_collection tables
- Created `src/lib/tableMapping.js` for consistent table name resolution

### 4. Multiple GoTrueClient Instances Warning
**Problem**: Multiple Supabase auth clients were being created, causing warnings.

**Solution**: This is a warning, not an error. The application creates separate clients for different schemas (kastle_banking, kastle_collection), which is intentional.

### 5. Ethereum Property Conflicts
**Problem**: Browser extensions (likely MetaMask) were trying to inject ethereum objects.

**Solution**: This is a browser extension issue, not related to the application. Can be ignored.

## Current Status

✅ Supabase API connection is working
✅ Tables are accessible through the correct schema-qualified names
✅ Authentication is no longer blocking dashboard loading
✅ Database has data in all required tables

## Next Steps

1. **For Production**: Set up proper user registration/login flow instead of auto-creating users
2. **Schema Access**: Ensure the Supabase project has both `kastle_banking` and `kastle_collection` schemas exposed in the API settings
3. **Environment Variables**: Make sure all deployment environments have the correct Supabase credentials

## Testing

The application should now load without the authentication and API errors. The dashboard will display with available data from the database.
